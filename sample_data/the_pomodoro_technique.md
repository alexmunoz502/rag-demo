# The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

These intervals are known as "pomodoros," named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique is widely used to increase focus and productivity. It can be applied to work, study, or even creative projects.

## How It Works

1. Choose a task to work on.
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes and start working.
3. When the timer rings, take a 5-minute break.
4. Repeat this cycle 4 times, then take a longer 15â€“30 minute break.

## Benefits

- Enhances focus by limiting distractions
- Encourages regular breaks to prevent burnout
- Helps track time spent on specific tasks

## Limitations

- May not suit tasks requiring extended deep focus
- Switching tasks every 25 minutes may interrupt flow
